# Diabetes_Prediction
Diabetes Prediction using Machine Learning

This project was developed during my internship at System Tron. The main objective of this project is to predict whether a person is diabetic or not using Machine Learning algorithms.

Tools & Technologies-

-Python
-Google Colab
-Machine Learning (Classification Models)
-Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn

Dataset-
Format: Excel file (.xlsx)
Description: Contains patient medical records like:

-Glucose Level
-Blood Pressure
-BMI
-Age
-Insulin
-Pregnancies
-Skin Thickness
-Outcome (Diabetic/Non-Diabetic)

Workflow-

-Data Collection
-Data Preprocessing
-Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
-Model Building
-Model Evaluation
-Prediction

Algorithms Used-

-Logistic Regression
-Decision Tree
-Random Forest
-K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

Output:
Model predicts whether a person is diabetic or not based on input data.

Conclusion:
This project helped me understand the practical implementation of Machine Learning algorithms and how data preprocessing & model selection plays a key role in prediction accuracy.
