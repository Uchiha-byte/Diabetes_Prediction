# Diabetes Prediction

## Overview

This project was developed during my internship at **System Tron**. The main objective of this project is to predict whether a person is diabetic or not using **Machine Learning** algorithms.

## Tools & Technologies

- **Python**
- **Google Colab**
- **Machine Learning** (Classification Models)
- **Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn**

## Dataset

**Format**: Excel file (.xlsx)  
**Description**: Contains patient medical records including the following attributes:

| Attribute          | Description |
|--------------------|-------------|
| **Glucose Level**      | Blood glucose level |
| **Blood Pressure**     | Blood pressure levels |
| **BMI**                | Body Mass Index |
| **Age**                | Age of the patient |
| **Insulin**            | Insulin level |
| **Pregnancies**        | Number of pregnancies |
| **Skin Thickness**     | Skinfold thickness |
| **Outcome**            | Diabetic/Non-Diabetic (Target Variable) |

## Workflow

1. **Data Collection**  
   Gather data from the provided dataset in Excel format.
   
2. **Data Preprocessing**  
   Clean the dataset by handling missing values, encoding categorical features, and scaling numerical values.
   
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   Analyze and visualize the dataset to understand patterns and relationships between features and the target variable.
   
4. **Model Building**  
   Train different machine learning models using the cleaned dataset.

5. **Model Evaluation**  
   Evaluate model performance using various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

6. **Prediction**  
   Use the best-performing model to predict whether a person is diabetic based on input data.

## Algorithms Used

- **Logistic Regression**
- **Decision Tree**
- **Random Forest**
- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**

## Output

The model predicts whether a person is diabetic or not based on the input medical data. The model provides a **binary classification** output, where:

- **1** indicates diabetic
- **0** indicates non-diabetic

## Conclusion

This project helped me understand the practical implementation of **Machine Learning algorithms** and how important **data preprocessing** and **model selection** are in improving prediction accuracy.
